## Development

<p>
This project was developed using Angular and Bootstrap. Which allowed me as a developer to improve my knowledge about the tools and behaviors of a single page application.</p>
<p>It´s consists of three main parts (navbar, content and footer).</p>

✅`NavBar:` In the navbar component I worked with Angular's routerLinkActive to make the description bold depending on which page the user is on and with Bootstrap as the screen size decreases the navigation bar becomes a sliding menu for the best user experience.

✅`Main content:` The main content depends on which page the user is on (home, products, about or contacts), it comes directly from custom routes in Angular RouterModule to render certain component. These pages can be accessed through the navigation bar or using the url in the browser. On the Home page, a user greeting with a "make a wish" button, some company details and demo products. The products page shows the user all the company's products, and these products come from a service containing each product and their respective details such as id, name, description, price and image of the products. Each product also comes with a "buy" button that, when clicked, will be directed to the final page with a personalized url by the id of the product clicked and a small form for the customer to inform the company of contact details and delivery of the product. The about page goes into more detail about the company and its values. Por fim, uma página de contatos para relacionamento entre clientes e a empresa contendo links de midias sociais da empresa  e um breve form para pegar dados do cliente.

✅`Footer:` The footer contains information and contact links about the developer of the project, in this case me.

## Challenge

<p>Building this project was a challenge for me, during its development I came across some bugs both logically and in design. There was a time when the project, when switching from one page to the next, did not display it at the top of the screen, but in the direction in which the scroll bar was on the previous page. So I developed a function for each button so that when clicked the user was directed to the next page starting from the top imperceptibly. It was a rewarding experience to develop this project, develop and show my skills through this work.</p>
